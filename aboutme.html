        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Being able to fly a plane is one of my talents. I am currently learning how to fly a plane with 
         the Coachella Valley Youth Aviation Education Program which is helping me get my private pilot’s license.
         After I get my license and graduate high school I plan on going to College of the Desert for two years and
         live with my friends. After college, I will go on my mission for the LDS church which will last another two
         years hopefully in another country. Finally, after all of that is done I hope to join the Coast Guard to fly helicopters for them. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Some of my major accomplishments are being accepted into the Aviation
         Education Program and becoming an Eagle Scout. I became a boy scout at 11
          and worked hard to get all my requirements completed. I moved about halfway through my progress and then when
         I became a Life Scout I had to wait six months which was a problem because the LDS church would cut off ties
         with the Boy Scouts of America in 4 months. I had to join a new troop in order to become an Eagle Scout. It
          was all difficult but it helped me with lots. Some of my characteristics that help with being a pilot are
         that I am observant,  I can think quickly, I have good team-working skills, and attention to detail. However,
         I think some words that would describe me from the Character Trait list are: calm, alert, creative, patient,
         trustworthy, loyal, helpful, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent. The
         majority of what I listed was actually just the Scout Law which all Boy/Eagle Scouts have to memorize.</p>
         <br>
         <p>I hopefully will become a helicopter pilot like my dad. I really enjoy flying airplanes and knowing how they work.
          Thank you for viewing this about me page and my website.</p>
